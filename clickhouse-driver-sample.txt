The clickhouse-driver is a Python client library for ClickHouse, an open-source columnar database. It allows you to connect to a ClickHouse server and interact with the database. Here are some basic examples of how to use the clickhouse-driver:

1. Install clickhouse-driver:

You can install clickhouse-driver using pip:

bash

pip install clickhouse-driver

2. Import the Library:

You need to import the clickhouse_driver module in your Python script:

python

from clickhouse_driver import Client

3. Connecting to ClickHouse:

You can create a connection to a ClickHouse server by providing the server URL:

python

client = Client('clickhouse://your_clickhouse_server')

4. Executing SQL Queries:

You can execute SQL queries using the execute method:

python

# Execute a simple SELECT query
query = 'SELECT * FROM your_table'
result = client.execute(query)

# Loop through the result set
for row in result:
    print(row)

5. Inserting Data:

You can insert data into a ClickHouse table using the execute method as well. Here's an example of inserting a row of data:

python

# Insert data into a table
insert_query = 'INSERT INTO your_table (col1, col2) VALUES (%s, %s)'
data_to_insert = (value1, value2)  # Replace with actual values
client.execute(insert_query, [data_to_insert])

6. Using Pandas DataFrames:

You can also work with ClickHouse data using Pandas DataFrames. You can convert the result of a query into a Pandas DataFrame for easier data manipulation:

python

import pandas as pd

query = 'SELECT * FROM your_table'
result = client.execute(query)

df = pd.DataFrame(result, columns=['col1', 'col2'])

7. Disconnecting from ClickHouse:

Don't forget to close the connection when you're done:

python

client.disconnect()

8. Using ClickHouse Databases:

You can specify the database to use within your connection URL:

python

client = Client('clickhouse://your_clickhouse_server/your_database')

This allows you to interact with tables and data within that specific database.

These are some basic examples of how to use the clickhouse-driver to connect to a ClickHouse database, execute queries, insert data, and work with result sets. The library supports more advanced features like query parameters, batching, and working with complex data types, among others.
